# Mysterium-Acrylic-TKL

This repository showcases my custom TKL keyboard build. 
Completely hand-soldered and firmware-flashed, it was a labor of love. While time-consuming, it's truly rewarding to be able to consider such a beautiful piece of tech a tool of my trade.
This build took about a year to collect all the parts, with the longest wait for the custom case to be built. The whole PCB was hand-soldered, and each switch socket is modified to use Mill-Max hotswap sockets to easily change switches anytime. I also built the custom cable using different colored Tech-Flex sleeving and GX16 aviator connectors.
